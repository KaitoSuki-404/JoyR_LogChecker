# JoyR_LogChecker
It's Kaito here.
This is a script for automatically checking render log written by pyghon.It's pretty simple, and I have no idea if it's gonna work on your individual platform.

You can try it out. I've set renderer mode for ARNOLD & REDSHIFT, just type the upper-case and there you go.Just in case you don't know)
